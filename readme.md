# Scarecrow Admin Panel

Scarecrow admin panel is a very simple html admin panel template.  It is based off of the old Gitlab design.  

Currently it only includes the responsive menu, that contains only top level links.

Expect a rewrite of the SASS at some point.

```
assets/sass
```
Contains the SASS for compiling.

```
html/stylesheets
```
Contains the compiled stylesheets.Contains

```
html/index.html
```
Demo of how to layout the site as well as small javascript snippet that needs to be added to your project for the menu to work.

The avatar was designed specifically with Gravatar in mind.  Other ways of doing it may work.
